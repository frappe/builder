## Frappe Builder

Frappe Builder is a low-code website builder designed for simplicity, speed, and flexibility. Craft beautiful websites effortlessly with an intuitive visual builder. Whether you're a designer looking for ease or a developer seeking customization, Frappe Builder empowers you. It also features a click-to-publish option that gives you the complete end-to-end website creation experience.

### Motivation

Most existing solutions were either too complex, too restrictive, or difficult to integrate with the Frappe ecosystem. Additionally, pages built with these tools were often bloated with unnecessary scripts and styles. I wanted to take a stab at solving this problem while prioritising performance from day one. I aimed to address two major issues with this project: providing an intuitive way to design a web page and enabling one-click publishing. As a web developer, it helps me scratch my own itch, and I hope it helps others too.

### Key Features

- ‚ú® **Intuitive Visual Builder:** Simplify your workflow with a Figma-like editor.
- üì± **Responsive Views:** Ensure your sites look great on any device without the fuss.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Frappe CMS Integration:** Easily fetch data from your database and create dynamic pages.
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Scripting Capabilities:** Customize with client scripts, global scripts, and styles.
- üöÄ **One-Click Publishing:** Instantly share your creation with the world in a single click.
- ‚ö° **Performance Excellence:** Frappe Builder does not bloat web pages with unnecessary scripts hence pages built with Frappe Builder are highly performant, consistently scoring high on Google Lighthouse tests.

### Under the Hood

- [Frappe Framework](https://github.com/frappe/frappe): A full-stack web application framework.
- [Frappe UI](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui): A Vue-based UI library, to provide a modern user interface.
